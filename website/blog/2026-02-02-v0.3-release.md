We're excited to announce **CodeVerify v0.3.0**, our biggest release yet. This update brings Copilot Trust Scores, Team Learning Mode, and a powerful new Verification Debugger—making it easier than ever to catch bugs in AI-generated code.

## Why This Release Matters

AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot have transformed how developers write code. But with great productivity comes great responsibility: AI-generated code can contain subtle bugs that are easy to miss in code review.

CodeVerify v0.3.0 directly addresses this challenge with features designed specifically for the AI-assisted development workflow.

## What's New

### 🎯 Copilot Trust Score

The headline feature of v0.3.0: an ML-powered scoring system that assesses AI-generated code quality in real-time.

```python
# CodeVerify analyzes this Copilot suggestion
def calculate_average(numbers: list[int]) -> float:
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# Trust Score: 72/100
# Risk: Division by zero when numbers is empty
# Confidence: High (Z3 proof found)
```

The Trust Score considers:
- **Formal verification results** — Did Z3 find a counterexample?
- **Code complexity** — Is the logic straightforward or convoluted?
- **Pattern matching** — Does this match known-buggy patterns?
- **Context awareness** — Does it fit the surrounding codebase?

### 🧠 Team Learning Mode

CodeVerify now learns from your team's codebase to provide more relevant findings.

When enabled, Team Learning Mode:
- Analyzes your repository's coding patterns
- Reduces false positives for your team's conventions
- Surfaces issues similar to past bugs in your codebase
- Shares learned patterns across team members

```yaml
# .codeverify.yml
team_learning:
  enabled: true
  share_patterns: true
  min_confidence: 0.8
```

### 🔍 Verification Debugger

Ever wondered *why* Z3 found a particular counterexample? The new Verification Debugger provides step-through visualization of the constraint solving process.

```bash
codeverify debug finding-123
```

This opens an interactive session showing:
- The constraints generated from your code
- How Z3 explored the solution space
- The exact variable assignments that trigger the bug
- Alternative paths that were ruled out

### 📊 AI Diff Summarizer

Tired of writing PR descriptions? CodeVerify can now auto-generate them:

```bash
codeverify summarize --pr 42
```

This analyzes your changes and produces:
- A concise summary of what changed
- Impact analysis on existing code
- Suggested reviewers based on code ownership
- Auto-generated changelog entries

### 📦 Monorepo Support

Full support for Nx, Turborepo, and Lerna monorepos:

```yaml
# .codeverify.yml
monorepo:
  type: nx  # or turborepo, lerna
  affected_only: true
  parallel: true
```

CodeVerify now:
- Detects affected packages from changes
- Runs analysis in parallel across packages
- Respects workspace boundaries
- Aggregates findings intelligently

### 🔐 Proof-Carrying PRs

Enterprise teams can now require cryptographic proof that code was verified:

```yaml
# .codeverify.yml
proof_attestation:
  enabled: true
  require_signature: true
```

This creates a tamper-proof record that:
- The code was analyzed by CodeVerify
- No critical findings were suppressed
- The analysis ran on the exact commit being merged

## Performance Improvements

v0.3.0 is significantly faster:

| Metric | v0.2.0 | v0.3.0 | Improvement |
|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Cold start | 4.2s | 1.8s | **57% faster** |
| Incremental analysis | 2.1s | 0.8s | **62% faster** |
| Large PR (500+ files) | 45s | 18s | **60% faster** |

We achieved this through:
- Parallel Z3 constraint solving
- Incremental AST caching
- Smarter diff analysis (skip unchanged code)

## Breaking Changes

### Configuration Updates

The `ai` configuration section has been restructured:

```yaml
# Before (v0.2.x)
ai:
  enabled: true
  semantic: true

# After (v0.3.0)
ai:
  semantic_analysis:
    enabled: true
    model: gpt-4  # Now configurable
  security_analysis:
    enabled: true
```

### API Changes

The `/api/v1/analyses` endpoint now returns a `trust_score` field. Clients expecting the old schema should update.

## Getting Started

Upgrade to v0.3.0:

```bash
pip install --upgrade codeverify
```

Or with Docker:

```bash
docker pull codeverify/codeverify:0.3.0
```

## What's Next

We're already working on v0.4.0, which will include:
- **Go language support** — Full formal verification for Go
- **JetBrains plugin** — IntelliJ, PyCharm, and WebStorm integration
- **Custom LLM support** — Bring your own fine-tuned models

## Thank You

This release wouldn't be possible without our community. Special thanks to everyone who reported issues, submitted PRs, and provided feedback.
